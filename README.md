# 📘 Book Selection Program

A simple Python command-line application that allows users to view book descriptions and decide whether to continue or exit the program.

## 🚀 Features

- Welcomes the user upon start.
- Prompts the user to select a book from a predefined list.
- Displays a brief description of the selected book.
- Allows the user to either continue or exit after viewing a book.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The program starts by printing **"welcome"**.
2. It displays a menu with available books:
   - Book 1: *The Psychology of Money*
   - Book 2: *Book 2 Description*
   - Book 3: *Book 3 Description*
   - Book 4: *Book 4 Description*
3. After selecting a book number (1–4), the program shows its description.
4. The user is then prompted:
   - Press `1` to continue.
   - Press `2` to exit.

## 🧠 Example Run

```bash
$ python new_file.py
welcome
Enter book number to continue: 1
psychology of money:--The Psychology of Money is the study of how our behaviors emotions, and mental biases influence our financial decisions, rather than our intelligence
press 1 for continue
press 2 for Exit
Continue or exit: 2
